Description: Object classes for long (database style, class stcs) and wide (crosstabulated, class mefa) representations of count data coded by sample, taxon and segment (i.e. sub populations, repeated measures) names. Supports easy processing of the count data along with relational data tables for samples and taxa. An object of class mefa is a project specific compendium of the data and can be easily used in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction, aggregation, conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of mefa objects. Reports can be generated in plain text or LaTeX format.
